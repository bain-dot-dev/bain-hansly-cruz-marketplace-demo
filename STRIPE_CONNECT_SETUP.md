# Stripe Connect Platform Setup Guide

## ðŸ”´ Error: "Only Stripe Connect platforms can work with other accounts"

This error occurs when your Stripe account is not configured as a Connect platform but your code is trying to create Express accounts.

## âœ… Solutions

### Option 1: Enable Stripe Connect Platform (Recommended for Production)

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard:**

   - Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings
   - Or: Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Connect

2. **Enable Connect:**

   - Click "Get started with Connect"
   - Choose your platform type:
     - **Marketplace** (for buying/selling between users)
     - **Platform** (for SaaS with payment processing)

3. **Complete Application:**

   - Fill out platform information
   - Describe your marketplace/platform
   - Wait for approval (usually quick for test mode)

4. **Get Platform Credentials:**
   - After approval, you'll get a `client_id`
   - May need to update your Stripe configuration

### Option 2: Development Workaround

For development/testing, you can temporarily disable Stripe Connect:

1. **Use Standard Payments Instead:**

   - Replace Express account creation with standard payment intents
   - Direct payments to your main account
   - Add seller tracking in your database

2. **Mock Stripe Connect:**
   - Create fake "connected" status in development
   - Test UI without actual Stripe integration

### Option 3: Alternative Payment Flow

If you can't enable Connect immediately:

1. **Single Account Model:**

   - All payments go to your main Stripe account
   - Track seller earnings in your database
   - Manual payouts to sellers

2. **Update Later:**
   - Migrate to Connect when approved
   - Transfer existing seller data

## ðŸ”§ Current Code Status

Your code has been updated to:

- âœ… Detect when Connect is not available
- âœ… Show helpful error messages
- âœ… Provide setup instructions
- âœ… Prevent infinite loops when failing

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **For Production:** Enable Stripe Connect in dashboard
2. **For Testing:** Use the updated error handling to guide setup
3. **Alternative:** Consider simpler payment flow without Connect
